about=The concept of groundwater vulnerability describes the vulnerability of an aquifer to contamination. Several score system models exist to calculate this vulnerability, for example DRASTIC, GLA, EPIK, GOD and PI. Version 2.0 of this plugin includes the German GLA method. It uses maps of available water capacity, annual percolation rate and aquifer covering lithology to calculate the protective function of an aquifer.
